# VXLAN_Fabric_Deploy

The VXLAN Fabric Deploy playbooks assist in helping engineers rapidly deploy a VXLAN Fabric using CML.  The playbook currently deploys two spine and leaf switches that are fully operational after running the playbook.  After completing "initializing" the fabric, VNIs can be added to test VXLAN L2 connectivity between devices.

# Directions:

The playbooks require at a minimum you have SSH connectivity to your devices.
